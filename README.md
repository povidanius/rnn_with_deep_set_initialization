# rnn_with_deep_set_initialization
This repositoruy contains two experimental models: <br /> <br />

1. RNN model with adaptive inital hidden state represented by Deep Set of input sequence. Hypothesis is that order-independent information (which is hard to extract for RNN) may improve the performance. <br />

2. RNN model with adaptive inital hidden state represented by Set Transformer of input sequence. Set Transformers usually beat Deep Sets on various benchmarks, hence one can hope that it will be more efficient in this model as well.
